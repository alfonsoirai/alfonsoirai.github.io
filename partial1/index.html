      	<h2>Explain the problem</h2>
        <p>In some school, students don't have access to their personal information, they need to go to a lot of offices to get one simple info, they waste a lot of time and sometimes, the school staff need more time to access that info. Also, this school don't have access to computer programs to learn.</p>

        <h2>Personal Motivations and Possible Solutions</h2>
          <p>We both are students and both have already been in institutions in which privacy has not been such an important issue when it comes to students’ personal information, such as absences, grades and so. Regarding specifically information that sometimes is not a matter to be proud of, but mistakes are made by everyone and every student has the right to keep this information as private as he/she wants.<br><br>

              The first solution already implemented is an example from one of our high schools, an official website in which any student is able to access grades and absences of any other student, completely disregarding the right of privacy of any student.</p>

      	<h2>Interview Process</h2>
           <p>First, I made an appointment with two teachers and the school's principal. I first speaked to a teacher that have been in the school since a long time ago. I explained the project objective and all the improvement that could be earned with this. She was very excited to have this in a very short term.<br><br>
           The second interview, was with the principal. I explained the project and he was very excited for this. He also, told me of some features that he wanted to add but, I told him that we needed some requirements that the school needed to cover before implementing this. He accepted everything and he promissed to purchase all the necessary equipment in order to this project to work.<br><br>
           The last interview was with another teacher that also teaches some programming courses. She was very excited and gave me all of the support to achieve this project and also, referred me with some students that will be intreted in participating on this project.</p>
         <h2>Qualitative Evaluation</h2>
           <p>Alfonso: I think that in this partial I would have a good grade, I made all my homeworks in time, just for one reading that I did not made it because I forgot about it. Beside that, I did everything on time. Also, I learned new stuff about the frameworks and some things in Codecademy.<br><br>
               Hector: I think my personal performance was not perfect, but I already knew about HTML and CSS, in spite of that I entered the code academy tutorials and watched a rather significant part of them. I also read… a little bit late, but I read all 4 readings and made every homework except for the Persona of the ISC student, which is the one I will be turning in late. So I consider my experience in this first period a good and hard working one.
