      	<h2>Brainstorm</h2>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Send an email to all the students each partial so they can know their info. Also send another email to the parents or legal guardians.</li>
            <li>Place some machines so the students can have access to their grades, absents, etc.</li>
            <li>Give the students sheets of paper so they can have all the information about their grades and absents.</li>
              <li>Send text messages to the parents or legal guardians about the student information.</li>
              <li>Create a school management system where the students, staff and parents can have access to the information about grades, absences in one single portal. (Choice)</li>
          </ul>
          
          We selected this idea because we want this school to aproach to the new technologies. Also, we think that it's going to be better for parents and teachers of taking control of their assignments and they are going to save a lot o f time when they want to have access to an especific data. Always keeping the privacy, because they will have an unique user id and password.
          </p>
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
          <p>
              <ol>
                <li>The first step was to come up with a problem that besides needing a solution motivated both of us teammates to solve a problem that we both have had in the past.</li>
                  <li>Then we wanted to choose a specific and real example that is unsolved still to these days.</li>
                  <li>With this defined, we started investigating if they wanted to be helped indeed, that meaning, if they thought of this problem as a problem, or if they thought that it was a functional and ethical tool to share information to their students.</li>
                  <li>Fortunately we both parts thought of this as a problem, we interviewed important people that was involved with the general direction of the school and also people that lived the problem in the everyday life.</li>
            </ol>
From this point on the next is to start with an iterative design process in which we go to write the real deal in code: the website.
One of the silver linings is that we can go as much as we want and ask for feedback, since it is an institution in which one of us was enrolled prior to this project.</p>

      	<h2>Create a Story</h2>
           <p>
               Genaro was a student in the X Academy, he had issues with his grades and absences, not because, they were particularly bad, but because he was not able to access to them, he had to wait until his teachers gave him every grade. This for Genaro was a real big deal since he was a rather edgy guy who was  really interested in having the best grades so he could enter a good University.<br><br>

Then, he was transferred to the Y Academy, this turned out to be the complete opposite, his grades and all of the students’ grades were available for every other student to check online. He was savagely bullied over his perfect grades, perfect attendance… and perfect teeth. Wedgies, wet willies and indian burns were poor little Genaro’s everyday meal, breakfast… and dinner.<br><br>

By the time he got to Z Academy, his hopes and dreams were crushed, and his self esteem was pretty busted too, that was the day in which Genaro’s dreams were unexpectedly revived. The system in which Genaro’s information was shared was a private and quick one. He could access from anywhere and no one but him and his parents were able to access that information.<br><br>

Things turned out to be just A-OK for little Genaro but… what about you? how is your information shared in your own institution?

           <h2>Grade your exam</h2>
           <p>We think we should get a <b>100</b> because we worked together to make this evaluation the best as possible. We did applied the knowledge that we got over the partial and try to put our best effort to create a quality website and good responses to the questions that were required.</p>
