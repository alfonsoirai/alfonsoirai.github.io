      	<h2>What?</h2>
        <p>The problem is that the students doesn't have any privacy regarding their personal info, such as grades, absents, etc. Also, the productivity in the school is very poor.<br>
        We made an investigations and had talks with former peer students and teachers and we all agreed that the way that our information was beeing used by the institution lacked of privacy and security since any other student or person that enter the website was able to see all the info.</p>
        <h2>Who?</h2>
          <p>The students, parents and staff of the school.</p>
        <h2>When?</h2>
          <p>In the school year.</p>

      	<h2>Where?</h2>
           <p>School installations and Internet</p>
         <h2>Why?</h2>
           <p>Because there is not a lot of money and the school haven't care for this situation. Their system is very "old school" and that means that the productivity it's also "old school".<br><br>
           Some teachers told us that the efficency in the school is very low because they do not have the appropiate infrastructure to give their courses the best possible. Students, always demand more information and tools to learn in this century, something that the school is a little behind besides it is a techincal school.</p>
        <h2>How?</h2>
           <p>
              Winning Idea<br> Generar un sistema de administraci&oacute;n escolar donde los alumnos, padres y maestros tengan acceso mediante un login y puedan consultar los datos de manera privada. As&iacute; como el redise&ntilde;o del actual sitio web: <a href="http://www.cbtis226.edu.mx" target="_blank">www.cbtis226.edu.mx</a><br><br></p>

        <h2>Social Impact</h2>
        <p>Students private information is being evideneced, something that can't happen today. Also, the tools that they are getting to improve their learning are almost null. This can carry out bulling, desertion, and also legal problems to the school because of the privacy policy.</p>

        <h2>Experts</h2>
        <p>I talked to:
          <ul>
            <li>Sergio Hernandez, Web Developer</li>
            <li>Gerardo Salinas, ITESM Computer Science Director</li>
            <li>Ken Bauer, ITESM Software Engineer Teacher</li>
            <li>Martin Moscosa, Web Developer</li>
          </ul>
          I did this to know about what tools and technologies we could use to make the project the best as possible. Their experience in this field will help us achieve the project a a very high quality.
        </p>

        <h2>Motivations</h2>
        <p>I used to be a student of this institution, something that gives me motivation are the tools that I been able to use since I'm in College. I think that a lot of tools are able to use for the high school students so they can achieve better learning and manage their private information correctly.</p>
