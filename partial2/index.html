              <h4>What is iterative design? Explain its importance in interaction design.</h4><p>Is a cycle of design, test and measure, and redesign repeated as much as necessary.
</p>
              <h4>Explain the status of your project. Grade it according to your effort (30%) and result (70%).</h4><p>Right now, our project is very advanced, we have finished the prototype of the web application of the admission process, also, the school website has been redesigned completely, making it more functional, and also more attractive to the user. Right now, without being pretentious, we think our project will have a 100.

              <h4>Explain, in your project, how do you achieve the following: action, knowledge, passion.</h4><p>We achieve action, knowledge and passion, by making the proposal to the school that we want to help, why? Because in our century, when the internet of things is happening and growing very fast, most of the public schools in our country doesn’t have access to a student and parent internet gate, where they can have their information in a very fast and simple way. This helps the students to keep track of their achievements and progress over the semester and the parents to keep track of how their children are doing. We implement our knowledge by making a friendly UI, and most of all, a neat one, where the students, parents, teachers and future students can have an idea of how the school works and be enthusiastic about what are they going to be into in the future. Also, we added an “apply now” section, where the future students can make their application to the school online, with no need of going to the school a lot of times to get their study guide and their admission test date, everything online, helping the environment, saving time and making the process more productive to the school.</p>
              <h4>Create your own methodology to develop a user interface. It’s important to justify all the steps.
</h4><p><b>a) Design inside our team:</b> This step is the perfect start for every functional user’s interface. It is not only the design using design programs but planning and mentally designing an idea using resources as simple but useful such as sketching and other tangible representations. Even though, at this point, we have not approached the audience through interviews, polls, etc. but it is important to have an inner discussion about what we want to achieve and why we want to achieve it, in other words, what we want to offer the user.<br>
<b>b) Approach the user:</b> This second step includes any kind of tests to the interface, we like to include functional tests in the last steps since it is part of the design process, the fact that a user interface works is mere pre-requirement, the real test is the way the user interacts with such platform, starting from how attractive the colors, shapes and other aesthetic aspects are to the user and the versatility of the platform, this including every other aspect like position of the buttons, bars, pictures, if there’s another function that the user would like to access in the interface, etc.<br>
<b>c) Re-design according to the user’s opinions:</b> As any iterative design model, it is important to have a step in which you add to the product all of those opinions that were shared by the user. It is important to mention that, one, as a developer has the freedom to include only those opinions that could be functionally useful to the interface itself, in other words, we need to listen to the users but we are the ones with the knowledge to discern if something is viable for the project.</p>
                <h4>Make a basic business proposal for your solution.</h4><p>
<b>Time length:</b><br>
The time it would take for us to develop the final product would be 6 months, since it is a website for educational purposes and it is for an official institution approved by the SEP (Secretaría de Educación Pública) special aspects have to be taken care of. Tests have to be made not only with random users at anytime, test subjects have to be students that can make use of the website during real school periods.<br>

<b>Special Features:</b><br>
The idea behind making this website is the lack of several benefits in the original website.<br>
Privacy is the main aspect we noticed this website was lacking. With our website, students, parents and professors will have immediate and secure access to every student’s absences, grades and academic details.<br>
The aesthetics is another theme that was drastically improved, organized and visually appealing menus, bars and options complement the functionality of this website.<br>
An additional resource that we will add to the website is the option to fill out all of the enrollment forms for each semester, they can also upload all of the documents needed such as Kardex, Birth Certificate and CURP.<br>
There is a fee for students that want to make the admission exam, this fee is no longer needed to be paid in the institution since we have added the option to pay with PayPal, Credit or Debit Cards and also they are able to print a form so they can make a deposit at their local bank.<br>

<b>Development Cost:</b><br>
The job done over this 2 months time period, resources and equipment used come at a cost of $120,000 MXN.<br>
Any appraisal or second opinion performed by a technician of the client's choice are welcomed and recommended for the sake of our client's conformity with the result of our work and reliability on our product itself.

                  <p>Well first, I think it could be affordable, but before implementing that, I would test the normal web application to see how is working and how much feedback we have from our students, parents and staff. Then, if we think it will be good to implement it into the iWatch, we will do so.</p>

        <div class="large-12 columns">
            <p>The task that the iWatch would be helping the user, is a rather simple one, that helps the user by giving him/her the freedom of checking and accepting the notification of a class that is soon to begin. So the interaction methods between the user and the watch for this specific case, are simple too. It makes use of the speaker/vibration function of the watch, to let know the user his class is about to begin, the user can accept the notification through the use of the touch screen.
After that another task is the one to let know the user that his attendance to such class was successfully registered in the system.</p>

              <div class="large-12 medium-12 small-12">
                  <p>As mentioned above, listening to the user after the design process has concluded, is a crucial part of the design process, because it helps you improve your interface.<br>
That is the best way to evaluate if the extension of the interface to the iWatch is working for the users. The best option we were able to come up with is giving some specific users (students) a watch or offering the apk so they can download the beta version of the app, and asking the after a week if it was useful for them or not.
